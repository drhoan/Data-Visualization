# Data-Visualization
Goal: Visualize and Analyse James Bond Movies data using pandas and matplotlib <br>
- Step 0: Clone this repo to your computer. <br>
- Step 1: Open the `james_bond_data_cleansed.csv` file using Excel and take a look at it to understand the data in the file. <br>
- Step 2: Create a jupyter notebook in VSCode. Save the notebook in the repo folder. <br>
- Step 3: Import pandas and matplotlib and use pd.read_csv() to read from the james_bond_data_cleansed.csv file. If you got error, you may need to install the two libraries by typing `pip install pandas matplotlib` in VSCode terminal. If the terminal doesn't understand pip, you may need to edit System Variables and add pip's path to system's Path. <br>
- Step 4: Answer the below questions:
  -	(1/4 pts) Is there a correlation between IMDb rating and Rotten Tomatoes rating? Hint: to answer this question, you can use plt.scatter() to create scatter plot with x-axis IMDb rating and y-axis Rotten Tomatoes rating. For more about scatter plot, check this link https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_scatter.asp. Your scatter plot should look similar to this

  -	(1/2 pts) What is the trend of income world â€“ movie budget ratio along the time? Hint: you can use bar plot https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bar-plot-in-matplotlib/ to plot this figure. Your figure should look similar to the one below.  From this trend, do you think producer make more profit now than they did in past?
